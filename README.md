# Title: Analysis carbon dioxide emissions in the UK

## abstract 
to be done

## Research Question
Overall, my study aims to provide further insights and grounds for predicting and reducing CO2 emissions in the UK. 

- First, I would use the five independent variables (GDP, population, urbanization, BEVs and REC) that were mentioned above, searching out answers to the research question: "Is there a significant correlation between the five independent variables and CO2 emissions in the UK?". 

- Then, I would choose London as an example which is the capital city in the UK, pointing out the higher carbon-efficient economy areas (showing low CO2 emissions and high economic contribution) and lower performance areas with high environmental costs.
